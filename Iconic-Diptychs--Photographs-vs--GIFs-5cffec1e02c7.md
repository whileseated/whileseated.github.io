While spending a weekend considering the photograph from Charlottesville of [the counter-protestor with the ‚Äúflamethrower‚Äù](https://medium.com/@whileseated/poking-a-moment-thats-passed-e6f9a1cf164f), I started wondering how many iconic photographs have been created _alongside_ video or motion picture footage.

Steve Helber, on the left; GIF of ACLU of Virginia‚Äôs video on the¬†right.

Predictably, most of the examples I could recall incorporated sports, breaking news, and unfortunately, often included scenes of war, murder/mayhem, and/or assassinations.

Rather than go long on what it means to see a still photograph vs. 29 frames a second, I thought I‚Äôd make a few quick GIFs for some diptychs.

### At left, the iconic photographs; on the right, GIFs that link to the original video¬†footage.

Here‚Äôs Jeff Widener‚Äôs version of Tank Man on the left, with TV coverage of the exact same scene on the right.

John Tlumacki, April 13th, 2013, in Boston. In the footage, from John Walls, via ABC News, the perspective shifts right at the moment when Tlumacki makes his picture. You can see him approaching the scene from right-to-left, and I‚Äôve paused the gif right at the end, when the photograph was made.
