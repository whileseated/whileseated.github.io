Republican Candidate for President Donald Trump and a spectacularly revved-up supporter, Daytona, Florida, August 3rd, 2016

**I’m “a big fan”** of [the video the Trump campaign posted](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/757012114460569604?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) the day after his acceptance speech at the RNC. It was a defensive analysis of how much applause-time comprised Trump’s epicly long-winded prime-time ramble.

In that spirit, I looked at fifty-one minutes from Trump’s address in Daytona, Florida, on August 3rd, and while initially distracted by the [“we’re on camera, honey!” kisses between this couple](https://vine.co/v/5qrYPgXQzOv), it was hard not to notice one spectacularly revved-up supporter, just over the candidate’s left shoulder.

**Here are all the moments** ([1min 37secs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03hxmAmOK0s), in sequence) in which this Trump fan had his thumb-down, reflexively booing Benghazi; every mention of Secretary Clinton; how the [U.S. unemployment rate has hit a new low of 4.6% under President Obama](https://twitter.com/JonErlichman/status/761541132425854976); or how Mexicans are making a run at the border to steal everyone’s job. (I jest — but yeah.)

Whether it’s the **LEFT-HAND HIGH**_,_ or the **FULL-BOO THAT MORPHS into both thumbs above his head**, he’s got it covered.

If you need a tutorial for how to express dissatisfaction with immigration policy, religious & ethnic tolerance, the scourge of political correctness, or how best to reveal your man-hand-sized outrage, here you go:
