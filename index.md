2014.04 - *Foreign & Domestic* (Curating an exhibiton photographs from Mark Alor Powell and Hannah Pierce-Carlson at Columbus State University)  
> "In the visual cacophony of a true megalopolis, Powell uses chaos to his advantage, drawing attention (compositionally & emotionally) to human authenticity; the little touches that make his subjects who they are. His is an exacting eye, carefully tuned to the weakness of power, and the strength of what’s hidden or unseen."
