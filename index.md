## 2014.04 - Foreign & Domestic
Curating an exhibiton photographs from Mark Alor Powell and Hannah Pierce-Carlson at Columbus State University.

> "In the visual cacophony of a true megalopolis, Powell uses chaos to his advantage, drawing attention (compositionally & emotionally) to human authenticity; the little touches that make his subjects who they are.

[[Medium link](https://medium.com/@whileseated/reconsidering-winogrand-5b4b22f977a2) & [Archive link](2009_Reconsidering-Winogrand.md)]  
> "It’s this quotidian attraction to the unspooling of time that creates the through-line of Winogrand’s effort. That there are precise moments and places on the planet where the truly extraordinary occurs, without actors, curtains, or fancy equipment, and that these places are often narrow and vanishing; perfect for a photographer with his finger on the shutter."
