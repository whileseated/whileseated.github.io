**2016.07** - *Can I interrogate this photograph? Can I hold it here in front of me, arrested?* (Looking at Jonathan Bachman’s photograph of an arrest in Baton Rouge) - [[Medium link](https://medium.com/@whileseated/can-i-interrogate-this-photograph-can-i-hold-it-here-in-front-of-me-arrested-62f81d0235fb) & [Archive link](2016_Can-I-interrogate-this-photograph-Can-I-hold-it-here-in-front-of-me-arrested.md)]  
> "What kind of Saturday was he looking for? Does it hurt too much to ask a question like that right now? How does a photograph enter the imagination and come out the other side, as something else entirely? Am I spending too much time talking about the police? Do I think they’re foolish, or do I think this photograph makes them look foolish? Do you?"


**2014.04** - *Foreign & Domestic* (Curating an exhibiton photographs from Mark Alor Powell and Hannah Pierce-Carlson at Columbus State University) - [[Medium link](https://medium.com/@whileseated/foreign-domestic-photographs-from-mark-alor-powell-and-hannah-pierce-carlson-76bf28cb2f8f) & [Archive link](2014_Foreign-Domestic.md)]  
> "In the visual cacophony of a true megalopolis, Powell uses chaos to his advantage, drawing attention (compositionally & emotionally) to human authenticity; the little touches that make his subjects who they are. His is an exacting eye, carefully tuned to the weakness of power, and the strength of what’s hidden or unseen."

> "It’s this quotidian attraction to the unspooling of time that creates the through-line of Winogrand’s effort. That there are precise moments and places on the planet where the truly extraordinary occurs, without actors, curtains, or fancy equipment, and that these places are often narrow and vanishing; perfect for a photographer with his finger on the shutter."  


**2008.07** - *American Beauty* (On the 50th Anniversary Edition of Robert Frank’s “The Americans” — originally published May, 2008, in The National — Abu Dhabi) - [[Medium link](https://medium.com/@whileseated/american-beauty-23a49eb042cb) & [Archive link](2008_American-Beauty.md)]
